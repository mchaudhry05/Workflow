# Workflow 

Workflow is a glorified todo list which allows you to track the tasks you have to do, tasks your working on, and tasks that you have completed. You can either make an account through the signup form or login using your Google Account. This will allow you to safe your todo list and access it anywhere you want. This web application was built using ReactJS and Firebase as a backend to save user data. 

# Installation

You can clone the repository and run npm start to play around with the todo list. You will need to change the firebase.js file to have your Firebase configuration key.
